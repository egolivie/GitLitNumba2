Today I went to the Flughafen.
I was there to finally go on my yearly trip to Berlin.
I am so excited to try new Gebaeck, one im looking forward to is Apfelkuchen.
They also have lots of gebaeck as well!
First thing I have on my to-do list is to go to the Biergarten.
I get very wettbewerbsfähig when I go there.
It's right along the Hauptstrasse.
I quickly went into a coffee shop to get some Klimaanlage.
There, I learned what a mehlhase was...
As I go to order a mocha and some banana Brot,
I hear the sound of a Porsche and a BMW rushing by.
i could tell those two were very Wettbewerbsfähig
They raced down the hauptstrasse, past the ratskeller, und baeckerei at such speeds!
